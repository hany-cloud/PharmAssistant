# PharmAssistant
 PharmAssistant is small and simple pharmacy store management system developed by avishekh bharati in ASP.NET MVC 
 using Entity framework code first approach. 
 The application has modules like: inventory management, transaction management: sales and purchase, security and user management, reporting services. 
 
 I just used this great application as a good tutorial and reference to learn more about ASP.NET MVC.
